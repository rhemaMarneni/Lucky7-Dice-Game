# Lucky7-Dice-Game
RULES:<br />You start with a balance of 2000 coins. <br />
				Then, you predict the sum of the numbers on the two dice on the next
				toss, by choosing a bet (each 500 coins).<br />
				If you were right, you get 1000 coins. But you don't get back the money
				you bet.<br />
				The game ends when you are down to 0 coins.
